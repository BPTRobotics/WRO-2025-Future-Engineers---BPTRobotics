## BPT Robotics engineering document

Our robot base is made out of wood and plastic. The robot has 2 ”levels”, the top is made out of plastic and where most of the electronics are, such as the Raspberry Pi, the batteries, the camera and the motor controller. On the lower level, is where the 3 distance sensors are, a servo motor to move the back wheels, and a storage device for the AI. 

The car moves  kinda like a forklift, the 2 front wheels are motorised while the ones in the back are rotated by the servo motor. The 3 distance sensors and camera help it avoid bumping into objects. 

The code for the robot was made in Python.
